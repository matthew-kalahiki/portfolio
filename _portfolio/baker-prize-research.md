As the recipiant of the [Baker Prize in Economics](https://www.hendrix.edu/Catalog/Academic_Departments_and_Programs/Economics_and_Business/#:~:text=Baker%20Prize%20in%20Economics,-The%20Baker%20Prize&text=Students%20compete%20for%20this%20award,a%20Hendrix%20College%20Economics%20Professor.), I had the oportunity to spend a summer performing undergradute research. This was a great experience where I was able to develope my writing skills, learn how to use the R programming language to run econometric models, and ultimately apply econometric theory to conduct real-world econimc research.

# Abstract
This paper examines the presence of indirect network effects in recent generations of the video game console industry. With vertical integration becoming increasingly popular in the rapidly growing industry, finding evidence of indirect network effects could have implications for the extent to which these mergers and acquisitions affect competition as strong platform specific indirect network effects can lead to lock-in effects. To find evidence of indirect network effects, we estimate a hardware demand equation in which demand is a function of software availability and a software supply equation in which supply is a function of the installed base of video game consoles. Our results indicate that regarding the sheer quantity of video games available for a platform, there is statistically significant evidence that both platform (console) wide and generation wide indirect network effects are present, but regarding the quantity of high-quality video games, there is only statistically significant evidence of the presence of generation wide network effects indicating that although platforms are positively impacted by an increase in video games available for their specific platform, the other video game consoles present at the time are also be positively impacted.
