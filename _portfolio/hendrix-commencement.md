The organizers of the annual Hendrix Graduation Commencement needed an easier way to create seating charts for the commencement. The previous process of manually entering names into Microsoft Excel was tedious and could take hours to complete. As a solution, We at Disco Tray Studios made a website to make it easier to create a seating chart as well as provide students with the ability to view the seating chart.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery." %}

I worked on most aspects of this project, including the seating chart view, data imports, administration functionality, and user authorization.
