Starting as a project for my Web Development course, me and a group of three other developers worked along side the head of the Hendrix Arboretum, Dr. David Sutherland, to create a website for the organization. 

Hendrix has a massive number of trees on campus, and over the years, Dr. Sutherland and his team at the Hendrix Arboretum have collected enourmous amounts of data on as well as labeled each tree on campus (and there are thousands!!!); however, all of the data was stored via Microsoft Excel workbooks on his on private computer, and their was no way for others to utilize this information when walking through campus. This is where my fellow developers and I came in to produce a website with a back-end database for others to be able to view information about the trees on campus.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery." %}

I primarily worked with the back-end of the website as well as the communication of information between the front and back-end of the site. This included implementing the database structure as well as the admin page where the admin of the arboretum can add,update, or delete trees and their informatoin in the database.
