[Arkansas Asset Builders](https://arkansasassetbuilders.org/) helps clients with their taxes, and they use an IRS tool to pull a variety of Microsoft Excel files with various information about clients; however, the amount of files as well as the format of the files make it difficult to view and analyze relevent data. Thus, we at Disco Tray Studios developed a desktop application for Arkansas Asset Builders to upload the Excel files that they pull from the IRS into a database. They can then apply a series of filters to easily view specific data and export the results.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery." %}

I primarily worked on the filter, data view, and export aspects of the project.
